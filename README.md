# System.Enums.FontAwesome

This super small project provides a strongly-typed enumeration that can be used to list icons from https://fontawesome.com/. The enumeration members are marked with [DisplayAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations.displayattribute?view=netcore-3.1)s to make them suitable for being bound to user controls such as selectlists and comboboxes.

The license of the project is MIT.
